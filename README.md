# weatherapp_flutterapp


This is a simple app designed using flutter to display the weather of the location your phone is in, it can also display the weather of a custom city whose details you would like to see.

The application starts with a loading screen while we fetch the location from the mobile device, we then contact the Openweathersite (openweather.org) using their api and retrieve the weather data which we then display on the app. We can also click on the top right icon to view the details of a custom city by typing the city name and then clicking on 'Get Weather'.
The top left icon is used to redisplay the weather details of our current location.

Below are the pictures of the application and the video of the app while it is working.
